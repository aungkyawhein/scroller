# Scroller

Just a simple Chrome extension to scroll up or down a page using mouse click.

* Some websites provide **back to top** button but usually don't have a **go to bottom** button.

* When some issues on Github have very long thread and I just want to go to last comment without scrolling with mouse wheel many times.

* When a lot of comments in our daily tasks and I just want to go to first or last comment quickly.

These are the problems I'm trying to fix with this extension.
